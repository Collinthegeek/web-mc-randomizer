# web-mc-randomizer

main.py runs a webserver so people don't have to run the python locally.

I wrote only main.py, Sethbling wrote randomize.py and Mojang wrote loot_tables/*

This uses web.py http://webpy.org/docs/0.3/tutorial

You could easily make this a lot better and add plenty of useful features
